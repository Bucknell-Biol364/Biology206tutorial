# Biology206tutorial

Introduction

R is an important tool in analyzing and creating visually effective representations of data sets. Biology professors at Bucknell are starting to incorporate this program in their courses to teach their students better ways to prepare data sets, analyze different types of data, and expand their horizons on presenting their data. This program allows you to explore data to formulate hypotheses and then employ statistical tests to assess them.

How to access and use this tutorial

In order to access this tutorial, you will need to download a couple of documents. To do this, click the green "Clone or Download Button" on the repo's main page. Then, click "download ZIP". This folder should now be in yor downloads folder, unzipped, and then moved to a location such as your desktop.

Open this folder and then find the "206 tutorial.Rmd" file. This is the R markdown file which is the tutorial you will be following to complete your assignment. This file contains a general introduction to R Studio that explains the layout and structure needed to work through the file. It also contains a guided tutorial that will help students navigate R to succesffuly construct, customize and interpret apects of a phyologenetic tree. Once your R markdown file is open, go to the "Files" tab and click "More". Then select "Set as Working Directory". 

Working through the document

Through step by step instructions, you should attack this document by working through one code chunk at a time. This will make sure that you understand how R works and that you fully understand what exactly you are doing. Even in large chunks of code, you should still run each line separately to determine the direct output. To run one line of code at a time, highlight the line and then hit command + enter. If at any point you get stuck during this tutorial, do not hesitate to use your friend Google! Stackoverflow is also a handy resource to use when you reach a problem.
